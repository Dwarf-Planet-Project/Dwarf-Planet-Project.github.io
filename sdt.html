	<h2>Project Scope</h2>
</div>

	<div class="project">
		<p>Currently the software only features a module for mission analysis which was inherited from the previous 
		   Space Trajectory Analysis Tool by ESA which has already been updated to compile despite an untouched code 
		   base since 2011 on current machines. The source code already compiles on Gentoo Linux and Ubuntu Linux. 
		   It is planned to revise the code to also support other Linux distributions, Windows and Mac OS X. Starting 
		   from successful builds on various platforms, the code base will be upgraded to replace the currently used
		   Qt4 with the latest Qt5 library. Further modifications will include the seperation of the code base into 
		   two parts, one handling the computations involved in the software, and the other providing a graphical 
		   user interface. Based on this framework more modules will be developed to cover more aspects of the design
		   of spacecrafts and space missions. A non-exclusive list of considered modules include:
		   <ul>
			<li> simulation of conditions during re-entry </li>
			<li> simulation of the thermal design of the spacecraft </li>
			<li> simulation of the damage by space debris </li>
			<li> simulation of the attitude and orbital control system </li>
			<li> simulation of particle radiation </li>
			<li> simulation of rocket engines </li>
			<li> simulation of on-board control systems </li>
			<li> simulation of vibrations during launch phase </li>
			<li> simulation of electromagnetic compatibility </li>
		   </ul>
		   Efforts in the project are currently focused on the evaluation of appropriate software libraries for the
		   different tasks. After completion an environment will be designed to combine the different libraries in
		   a proposed co-simulation environment to allow coupled simulations of different solvers. </p>
